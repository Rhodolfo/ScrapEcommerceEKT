1. Get a list of categories from the index https://www.famsa.com/, this gives us a tree of structure:
	category -> subcategory -> subsubcategory ...
We filter this tree for the bottom level categories, which hold product data. 
Sometimes the URLs are strange, see
	https://www.famsa.com/mochilas-y-accesorios
for these we need to fectch the subcategories directly (they tend to be top level categories).

2. Once we have a list of the deepest categories in the tree, 
we iterate over them to fetch pricing data for the products inside each category.
I keep track of the top level categories for checkpointing.

Pricing data is actually in JSON format, see parsing.scala for details.
