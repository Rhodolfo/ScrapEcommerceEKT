General strategy:

1. Fetch all departments and categories from the index page, this gives us a list of categoryIds.
	https://www.coppel.com

2. POST to the /ProductListingView page to get a list of products with prices, parameters for this POST were obtained in step 1.
	https://www.coppel.com/ProductListingView?catalogId=10001&categoryId=13031&storeId=12761&disableProductCompare=false

3. Sometimes the pricing data is missing, so we need to visit each product page to fetch that.

I use case classes under case.scala to hold data, 
http requests are handled by the object in http.scala,
the rest of the file names should be self explanatory.
